<h2>Blunt Persona</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You catch a person who doesn't want to be thrown at enemies and promptly carry them around and throw them at enemies. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Resource Management. Also, physics and the willingness to do what no on else will for the sake of all that is good.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Platformer, Cartoonish Violence
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Arrow keys to move, catch the purple block and carry him over your head (automatic on contact). Use A and D to throw the block once caught in said direction (A for left, D for right). The current motion of your block matters (at least horizontally). Use the purple block to eliminate the yellow blocks (The "Jitters"). The purple block doesn't want to be thrown at the yellow blocks, and will try to run away from you.

You can Wall Jump on a collision with a wall. It will be your friend. Use it wisely. Or just frequently.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Taking another sideways look at platforming, this time from the combat perspective. A bad throw can result in you having to chase down your ammunition for some time. Of course, the current build doesn't have lethal enemies (they do nothing, in fact), but eventually that's the goal. Maybe add spike pits too...

Anyways, the goal for the prototype was to test the interest in using a mobile and unwilling weapon with limited functionality. It was a hit here at the dorm.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Blocks
Use the Prince/Princess (slave?) you saved (captured?) to defeat their (your?) foes!
Jitters!
More Blocks!
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Uknown at this time.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
See Setting/Premise
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Platform/Puzzler players
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
1-4 minutes, there isn't a finished level really, though there is about (exactly) 20 yellow blocks to destroy with your friend.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Using your momentum to lengthen or shorten throws.
Wall Jump to maintan mobility whilst carrying the captive.
</li>

<li><strong>Estimated Schedule:</strong>
Went together pretty easily this time I'd say. Needs more work around the physics of course (main component, ideally). As with all of my projects, art is another thing entirely. I'd say with some dedicated work time (full time work, really) you could have a servicable demo or even small game together in a month, maybe two.
</li>

<li><strong>Team:</strong>
Anthony Sermania: Lead Everything
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Red, Purple, Yellow and Green blocks made with Gimp and assembled in Tiled as necessary (just the green ones really, the rest were used as sprites)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Thomas was alone; inspiration for the art of all future prototypes from me. Seriously, play it. Cool game.
